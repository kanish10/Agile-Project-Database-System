# CPSC 304 project

## Project Description

The domain for our project is Software Engineering project management and tracking. We want to mainly focus on tracking the tasks, blockers, bugs, repositories, deadlines and versions for software engineering teams. Although we have a component related to tracking employees and departments, we do not intend to make it the main emphasis of our application.

The database models the following domains:
1. Project Management
2. Team collaboration and organization
3. Task tracking and team member assignments
4. Bug tracking
5. Deadline and time tracking
6. Project version and release tracking
7. Project repository 

The aim of the application is to aggregate and store all this data in a single place and be able to query it efficiently. This can resolve situations where two disjoint teams are working on the same project and need to collaborate efficiently to distribute tasks and solve bugs or view changes in various software releases over the years and be able to contact the people who worked on a previous release.
